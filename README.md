# Dynamic-Filtering-and-State-Contingent-Signal-Generation-USD-EUR-Trading-Strategy
This project focuses on designing a trading strategy for the USD/EUR currency
pair using interest rate differentials. The approach involves fitting a filter with a specified gain,
computing standard deviations of filter errors, and generating state-contingent signals based on
a boundary of inaction. The strategy aims to exploit market movements and adjust positions
dynamically. The project further visualizes the filter and interest rate differentials, describes the
trading strategy, presents the equity curve, computes annual rates of return, evaluates the Sharpe
Ratio, and assesses the strategy’s performance.Sensitivity analysis explores the impact of varying
filter parameters on the strategy’s behavior, seeking potential optimization for improved results.
